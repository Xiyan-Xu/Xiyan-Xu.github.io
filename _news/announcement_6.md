I joined [WeRide.ai](https://www.weride.ai/) as a Machine Learning Engineer intern, where I collaborated with the simulation team on Traffic Scenario Generation. This work focused on creating controllable BEV traffic scenarios for simulation, enabling the evaluation and testing of vehicle planning and prediction modules.
