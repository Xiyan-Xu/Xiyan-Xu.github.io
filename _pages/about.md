I am a first-year MSCS student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) coadvised by Prof. [Yuxiong Wang](https://yxw.web.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Liangyan Gui](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/lgui). Before joining UIUC, I received my B.S. degree in Intelligence Science and Technology (Honor Track) from [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), Peking University, advised by Prof. [Libin Liu](http://libliu.info/) and Prof. [Baoquan Chen](https://baoquanchen.info/).

My research interest lies in the intersection of computer graphics and computer vision. In particular, my current research focuses on **Human Motion Synthesis**, revolving around the fundamental challenge of modeling and generating realistic human motion. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.
